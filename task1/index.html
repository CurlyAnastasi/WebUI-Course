            <h3>Task 1</h3>
            <p>Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns
                the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation
                of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
                Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function
                should return 5 in this case.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Task 2</h3>
            <p>
                Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is
                the position
                the word should have in the result.
                ​
                Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).
                ​
                If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid
                consecutive
                numbers.
                ​
                Examples
                "is2 Thi1s T4est 3a" --> "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
                "4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2" --> "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
                "" --> ""

            <h3>Task 3</h3>
            <p>Most football fans love it for the goals and excitement. You are to handle the referee's little notebook and
                count
                the players who were sent off for fouls and misbehavior.
                The rules: Two teams, named "A" and "B" have 11 players each; players on each team are numbered from 1 to
                11. Any
                player may be sent off the field by being given a red card. A player can also receive a yellow warning card,
                which
                is fine, but if he receives another yellow card, he is sent off immediately (no need for a red card in that
                case).
                If one of the teams has less than 7 players remaining, the game is stopped immediately by the referee, and
                the team
                with less than 7 players loses.
                A card is a string with the team's letter ('A' or 'B'), player's number, and card's color ('Y' or 'R') - all
                concatenated and capitalized. e.g the card 'B7Y' means player #7 from team B received a yellow card.
                The task: Given a list of cards (could be empty), return the number of remaining players on each team at the
                end of
                the game (as a tuple of 2 integers, team "A" first). If the game was terminated by the referee for
                insufficient
                number of players, you are to stop the game immediately, and ignore any further possible cards.
                If a player that has already been sent off receives another card - ignore it.
